# Exercism.io Challenge Solutions

This repository serves as an automated archive for my programming solutions for the [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) platform.

## Repository Structure

The content of this repository is automatically managed by the `exercism-solutions-syncer` bot.

**Important Point:** The bot does not push solutions to the `main` branch. Instead, **each exercise is saved in its own individual branch.**

To view the code for a specific solution, please use the branch selection menu above.

The `main` branch will only contain this README file and any other general documentation.

## Language Tracks

The primary focus of this repository is practicing the following languages:

* **C++**
* **Java**
* **Javascript**
